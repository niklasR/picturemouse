  <p>Just spoke to David. He said not to worry too much about the database object. He would have preferred that we had another class which rolled back and forth from the file and stuck it in the database object. He said to focus on getting the front end working instead. Email David about the Newsletter thing.</p>
  <p>Are we meeting up over the weekend? I do not mind if you cannot as I have a lot of work to do as well</p>

  <p>So what's our plan now? I suggest finishing it all within the first week of April. Will we still meet on Sunday?</p>

  <p>I think get as much as we can on Sunday done, at least documentation etc as we are probably going to be unable to meet in person once term ends.</p>
  <div class="message">
    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">John Every</span><span class="meta">Friday, March 21, 2014 at 4:50pm UTC</span></div>
  </div>
  <p>I was thinking that we would do everything up until the coding before term ends. Then do the coding over the Easter break as we do not need to be together for that as long as each person is clear on what parts of the system they are coding. I was thinking just sticking to the same use cases as before. So we will have to set it all up on Github before the term ends and complete the documentation. Then over Easter we talk on Facebook, do our individual discussion logs and draw the designs and code our respective parts of the system. We then organise a meeting just before the deadline in the Red room to brush it up, complete the overall discussion log, etc. and print it out to hand in.</p>

  <p>How does meeting at 11 sound? Are we planning on doing all the documentation together tomorrow? I feel it we would be more effective working on things individually rather than working on one thing all together.</p>

  <p>I agree with working individually but some of the tasks need to be done with us there together. Leaving the designs and code for each use case window to do over Easter individually. 11 is fine for me, we shouldn't be there too long. I will bring my books and notes.</p>

  <p>I have updated the use case diagram and textual scenarios, however I have a few queries. For instance the browse films use case allows you to browse all the films and read all of the reviews, synopsis and watch the trailer for each. How will this be incorporated into our system?</p>
  <div class="message">
    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">John Every</span><span class="meta">Sunday, March 30, 2014 at 12:01pm UTC+01</span></div>
  </div>
  <p>Also the specification seems to imply that the "cancel and start again" alternative is only able to be done when a film, review or account is chosen, but this process must be able to be started any point afterwards within the system. How will this be integrated into the system?</p>
  <div class="message">
    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">John Every</span><span class="meta">Sunday, March 30, 2014 at 12:04pm UTC+01</span></div>
  </div>
  <p>Also I feel that the customer name text field in the Sketch gdraw file should be changed to user name, because the same sign on window will be used by both customers and administrators but they will be directed to different areas of the system.</p>
  <div class="message">

  <p>Finally I will be starting the system requirements part now and detailing my progress in my log. Also Jake could you make the use case diagram look nicer and clearer, as I have made some changes. Also is the navigation and window sketch diagram close to being finished yet?</p>

  <p>I tried to separate the git hub code into two packages for front and back ends. Then I committed and synced it with Github and the code has been ruined because of merging branches or something. I need only the last commit to be undone but when I try, it rolls back more than just the last commit.</p>

  <p>At the moment we have the administrator options kind of separated in a different diagram (but some bits are in the 'Sketch' diagram too). Should we combine the customer and administrator aspects into one diagram? I feel like they should be combined together as they are combined in one system.</p>

  <p>The basics of all the windows should be in the Sketch file now. The window navigation I have started, but probably won't have time to finish until early next week. If anyone gets a spare moment feel free to fill some of it in! Just a question of copying and pasting windows from the sketch and linking buttons to other windows. Also take a look at all the windows in the sketch and see if you disagree/want to add anything there.</p>

  <p>I do not think that we should have the confirmation form, instead just a message box appears that says booking confirmed and then once "OK" is pressed by the user they are taken back to the user options screen. Because confirmation seems to do basically what print ticket does.</p>

  <p>Can we make it seats, but a multi select option? Like in HTML a slect field within in a form as 'multiple'? And then with the individual seats, so the customer can choose the seats, and select as many as they wish?
    
    The system then calculates the total price, etc.</p>

  <p>Should we implement a variable to save whether a ticket has been printed, so you can only print it once, but you can still see the booking?</p>

  <p>I think the variable is a good idea, but because it does not say in the specification that we can't print a ticket more than once, I don't think it is needed.</p>

  <p>Also why do we have the isAdmin field when all administrators have the same username?</p>

    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">John Every</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, April 23, 2014 at 9:32pm UTC+01</span></div>

  <p>I think we should keep it simple by only allowing administrators to change the username, password, first name and credit card number fields.</p>
  <div class="message">
    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">John Every</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, April 23, 2014 at 9:33pm UTC+01</span></div>
  </div>
  <p>With edit film I think we should allow administrators to change all details of Film including Screenings and the fields of screenings except for seating plan. Because we can assume that the cinema's screen structures will not change.</p>

    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">John Every</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, April 23, 2014 at 9:37pm UTC+01</span></div>

  <p>Apart from the edit film and account forms(which I will look at tomorrow) all of the forms have been implemented in Netbeans. Trailer however is blank because I am not sure what we are doing with that yet. Feel free to change the forms but if you are going to change them substantially including changing variable names then let me know first.</p>

  <p>I believe in regards to modifying films that we should allow Administrators to add and remove films but to change the screenings they should be allowed to browse all the screenings and then adapt specific ones, however a table may allow them to do this quicker. I will give this some thought and implement it. I have implemented the Modify Account form and changed all edit and amends to modify to keep in line with spec.</p>

  <p>This I think is probably the most helpful entry.
    Netbeans seems to add most of them automatically, but not for those, as (I'm guessing) you added the statements within the source manually. So, if you try with the annotation, as suggested, that might work</p>

  <p>And as NetBeans does the same for its auto-generated code, I think we should be fine. John, what do you think? We could ask somebody who knows more about this, I guess…</p>

  <p>I think it should be fine. I've never seen a warning like this before, so I'm not really sure how important it could be. The fact that the generated code already suppresses warnings tells me it isn't a horrible thing to do!</p>

  <p>Also I am currently doing NewUser and I wanted to know if it matters whether the user knows which fields they have entered are invalid. Or is just saying at least one is invalid be enough?</p>

  <p>certain swing functions, such as swing.JList&lt;&gt;.setListData, produce a 'note' warning at compilation (but compile &amp; run), saying the file uses unchecked or unsafe operations.</p>

  <p>Sorry, John, when you say "can you please fix it so that it also checks that someone is in the database and can sign on" do you want me to look up in the database whether a username/account exists before we try to sign them on?</p>

  <p>Can I make the BrowseFilm constructor take in a boolean as an argument for whether the user is an admin or not? It would work I think, I just don't know if you would prefer me do it a different way?</p>

  <p>Is that in the front or backend</p>

  <p>Well, for most classes we need the username anyway, so no reason why you couldn't just check username == "Administrator" and save that as boolean.</p>
  <div class="message">
    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">Niklas Rahmel</span><span class="meta">Sunday, April 27, 2014 at 9:13pm UTC+01</span></div>

  <p>(I believe something like that is the reason that we initially had isAdmin as attribute for user, but that's irrelevant now)</p>

    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">Niklas Rahmel</span><span class="meta">Sunday, April 27, 2014 at 9:14pm UTC+01</span></div>

  <p>--&gt; Once you got the username, that is.</p>

  <p>Right, that makes sense, but how do we know the username? will that need to be entered as an argument into the constructor?</p>

  </div>
  <p>Yep. Need in in the backend, too, as we need to look up the Account object by username in things like BookTicket</p>

    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jake Carr</span><span class="meta">Sunday, April 27, 2014 at 9:34pm UTC+01</span></div>

  <p>We could, but when we are moving between forms, we are creating a new instance of the form every time it navigates from one to another.</p>

    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jake Carr</span><span class="meta">Sunday, April 27, 2014 at 9:35pm UTC+01</span></div>
  </div>
  <p>I guess, the only time we create a new instance of the sign on page is when we start the program, when the user signs out and when the user creates a new user. In these situations we don't need to keep the previous username anyway I guess.</p>

  <p>I don't think we were told in any lectures how frequently we should do it. I guess it depends whether we prioritise performance (ie not saving after every action) or reliability (saving often enough to avoid data loss)?</p>

  <p>Also, if there was a powercut or similar, and there is no UPS or so in place, or the system crashed, the effort to 'recover' the lost data would only be one session per terminal, so not more than max. a couple of bookings to make again</p>

  <p>Couldn't we have it as an option only that Administrator can see when they are logged in? So the admin can login and quit. Quitting would have to save the db as well then since it would bypass the saving when signing out.</p>

  <p>I think you are making it more complicated than it needs to be. It works fine as sign out is in both administrator options and customer options, meaning that they will sign out. They are unlikely to quit, especially if you want me to put an extra warning message in the message box such as "Do not quit the program until closing time". Also I have finished the functionality in the NewUser form; have a look and try it out, it seems to work.</p>

  <p>And what does the next user do? Come to a command line prompting them to run a java command? Or a windows terminal allowing them to compromise the system, be it on purpose, or in the process of figuring out how to book a ticket.</p>

  <p>Move Quit to Administrator Options?
    I just realised it was in Sign on, I thought for some reason it was in CustomerOptions, which makes the issue less important.</p>

  <p>John, I don't think you need to worry about progress. Testing will be the most time-consuming. I was just so surprised to do the DistributeNewsletter, and it worked first try. Loading Database, Loading content, Writing content, checking if it's there. We're good.</p>

  <p>ReadNewsletter now done and uploaded. I added an extra bit where if there is no newsletter yet (or if we choose to delete a newsletter by distributing a blank newsletter) it will say "There is currently no newsletter to display" so it will never give the end user a blank text box (which I guess is considered poor design).</p>

  <p>I have made it so the Film form changes depending what film is choosen in the BrowseFilm form. Which is a nice little step in the right direction! I used your suggestion of using public static variables, John. To test it, run the BrowseFilm frontend file (Not Film).</p>

  <p>I am currently doing BrowseTickets and think we have a bit of a design problem. When browsing tickets we can use the username to lookup the account to pull the list of tickets. These tickets contain a seat and a screening id. We need the film name, but I can't see that we have any way to find the film name (or even just the filmId) which just the screeningid and seat, or am I missing something?</p>

  <p>Surely you wouldn't need to create an ArrayList for reviewsData etc instead just fill a normal array. This would be more efficient.</p>

  <p>To make it easier with importing the backend stuff would it better to call all backend classes a different name to frontend class such as BEModifyReview and FEModifyReview. Or does this not really matter.</p>

  <p>Ok, one issue with BrowseFilms - if we integrate it correctly with the backend, the frontend won't need database access, and thus will only have the film names, not the synopsis or Id.</p>

  <p>Thus Film or ModifyFilm couldn't get the filmId (or Synopsis for that matter) from BrowseFilms(). Unless we
    
    -a make BrowseFilms get the data from the database itself (but what is he backend module for then?)
    -b chenge the backend module to supply not just the filmName, but also the filmId &amp; Synopsis</p>

  <p>John, I needed the screenings in BookTicket, maybe you could take a look at that.</p>
  <div class="message">

  <p>For BrowseScreenings, do you want the Screening Objects? Or just a String of something.</p>
  <div class="message">
    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">Niklas Rahmel</span><span class="meta">Tuesday, April 29, 2014 at 1:28pm UTC+01</span></div>
  </div>
  <p>Because if you needed Screening Objects, you would probably have to get them yourself from the database with the filmId, as BEBrowseFilms can only return a String t FEBrowseFilm, which saves the relevant Strings of the selected Film.</p>
  <div class="message">
    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">Niklas Rahmel</span><span class="meta">Tuesday, April 29, 2014 at 1:28pm UTC+01</span></div>
  </div>
  <p>To save the screenings of the selected Film, we'd have to refactor all that code.</p>
  <div class="message">
    <div class="message_header"><span class="user">Niklas Rahmel</span><span class="meta">Tuesday, April 29, 2014 at 1:30pm UTC+01</span></div>
  </div>
  <p>So BEBrowseFilms passes Objects, but then FEBrowseFilm would deal with all that, and that's probably not the point of having a backend integration.
    Thus BrowseScreenings should be able to get them itself, but there is no BE-class to do that.</p>

  <p>Cool, I am going to do Browse screenings, modify Screenings, Add Film button functionality. Then I have to adapt modify film to account for these changes. DO you need me to record my testing? because I have not done much testing up to this point due to limited time available. I will fix nullexceptions problems with select, should be fairly easy.</p>

  <p>Ollie, BookTicket works fine here. If I had issues, I'd just delete the whole project in SourceTree (github app for you I guess), and from my hard drive, and add it again, so it gets put on from Scratch.</p>

  <p>That was my bit initially, and there was never much it could do in the backend, as there is nothing to do with the database or so, that would require backend computation. We implemented it mainly, because it was a use case in the spec, and therefore in the use case diagram and then in the class diagram.</p>

  <p>Book ticket is good on the whole but it seemed to fill all of the seat numbers after you click in screenings and the changing of the colours of the labels doesn't work quite right.</p>

  <p>BookTicket no longer works, because you've added an element to the first model, which is the text "Please select a screening...", please can we delete this as I cannot be bothered to fix the indexing problem it has caused</p>

  <p>Ok but the program is coming along, apart from minor niggles (nullpoiters etc), Browse Screenings and Film and Modify Screenings and Films are the only ones not currently working. Could you guys have a look at those please? As I will be AFK for the next 4 hours ish but I will have a look at all that and my documentation later in the morning. I do not think it is that Nik because a message box is supposed to appear before that and it doesn't but what you are saying makes sense.</p>

  <p>In terms of coding it is mainly the modifyFilms section and constituent parts that need refining but I have got some more of it to work this morning. I think apart from making sure that the program does not die when there are no accounts in the system for example then we are pretty much there.</p>

  <p>Ok, that's cool. I'm on the bus so I have no Internet on my laptop. In FEModifyFilm, null is being enter into the BEModifyFilmDetails doIt() method which then makes the screening variable in film null. This is where the null pointer exception is coming from when trying to run browse tickets and book ticket right now.</p>
